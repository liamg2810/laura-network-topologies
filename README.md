## Introduction

This project is designed to help understand different network topologies such as bus, star, ring, and mesh. It provides visual representations and explanations of each topology.

## Network Topologies

-   **Bus Topology**: A single central cable to which all network devices are connected.
-   **Star Topology**: All devices are connected to a central hub.
-   **Ring Topology**: Each device is connected to two other devices, forming a ring.
-   **Mesh Topology**: Devices are interconnected, with multiple paths between them.
-   **Hybrid Topology**: Mixture of two or more topologies.
-   **VLAN Topology**: Different networks are connected by a virtual LAN.
